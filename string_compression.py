# Given a string s consisting of lowercase alphabets, your task is to compress it in the most 
# efficient manner possible. The compression should be done such that if the compressed 
# string is longer than the original string, then return the original string.
# The compression rule is as follows:
# If a character c appears consecutively in the string, then it should be replaced by c followed 
# by the number of consecutive occurrences of c.
# For example:
# "aabcccccaaa" should be compressed to "a2b1c5a3".
# "abc" should remain as "abc" as the compressed version is longer.
# Write a function compress_string(s: str) -> str to accomplish this task. Constraints:
# The input string s consists of only lowercase English letters.
# The length of input string is between 1 and 10^4.
